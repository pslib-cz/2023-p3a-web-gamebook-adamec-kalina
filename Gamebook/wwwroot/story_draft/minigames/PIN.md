You have 10 attempts to figure out a 5-digit code to hack the door. There are no repeated numbers in the 5-digit code.
In each attempt you will get a result that prompts a number of "W" results and "L" results.

"W" means that in your guess, there is a number that is in the correct position and value.
"L" means that in your guess, there is a number that is in the incorrect position but correct value.

code:

- numbers cannot repeat
- first 2 numbers cannot be 9 (0 to 8)
- starting is X and ending number is X+1
- 2nd number is Y and second to last number is Y+1
- XY....(Y+1)(X+1)

for example: codelenght is 6
742658
(X-Y-26-Y+1-X+1)

HINT:

Mysterious Guest: "Let me break it down for you. The first number is less than 9, and so is the second number, but they are not the same. The second to last number is one more than the second number, and the last number is one more than the first. And there are no repeating numbers in this code."
```
