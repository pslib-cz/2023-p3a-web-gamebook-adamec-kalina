# Quest 5: Sabotage (Time Line Physical Abilities)

- player goes to **Secret Meeting Place**
- player talks to **Hacktivist leader**
```
Hacktivist leader: 'We have an urgent situation. A corporation is about to launch a new project that could have serious consequences for the public. We need to stop it before it's too late."
Shadow Viper: "What exactly should I do?"
Hacktivist Leader: "We need you to infiltrate one of their key industrial facilities and sabotage this project to stop it."
Shadow Viper: "What security does that facility have?"
Hacktivist Leader: "It's well guarded, with state of the art security. But with your physical abilities, you should be able to get in and perform the necessary actions."
Shadow Viper: "Sounds like a challenge. What's the plan?"
Hacktivist Leader: "You need to get in, find key systems, and cause damage that will slow or completely shut down their operations. It's important to make it look like an accident to avoid direct communication with our group."
Shadow Viper: "Understood. I'll need detailed information on the layout of the facility and its systems."
Hacktivist Leader: "We'll provide everything you need. It's a risky operation, but we're confident you can handle it."
Shadow Viper: "All right, I'll get ready and then I'll be on my way."
```

- player goes to **Tactical Room.**
- player talks to **Technical Expert**

```
Technical Expert: "We have limited information about the layout and security systems of the facility, but enough to make a plan."
Shadow Viper: "What is the main objective of the sabotage?"
Technical Expert: "The main objective is to shut down their central control system. That should bring the entire project to a halt and cause them considerable delay."
Shadow Viper: "How do I get in? And what obstacles can I expect?"
Technical Expert: "The best way is through the side entrance they use for deliveries. It has less security. Once inside, you'll have to negotiate a series of security doors and maybe a few guards."
Shadow Viper: "I plan to use silent infiltration if possible. I need an exact schedule of patrols and security information."
Technical Expert: "We have records of their routines. I'll supply you with the exact times as well as the tools to bypass security."
Shadow Viper: "What plan do we have for escape?"
Technical Expert: "Once you've sabotaged the system, activate the emergency exit. We have an escape vehicle ready for you near the facility."
Shadow Viper: "Excellent, that sounds like a solid plan. As soon as I have all the information I need, I'll be on my way."

Shadow Viper: "The sabotage was successful. Systems are down, and that should delay the corporation for quite some time."
Hacktivist Leader: "Well done, Shadow Viper. Your actions have caused considerable complications for the corporation and given us valuable time to plan further."
Hacktivist Leader: "What was it like in there? Did you run into any problems?"
Shadow Viper: "There were a few guards, but I managed to get past them. My new abilities proved crucial to the success of the mission."
Hacktivist Leader: "Your skills and courage are invaluable to us. This sabotage gives us more than just time. It strengthens our position and gives us more influence."
Shadow Viper: "I'm ready for the next mission. Whatever you need, I'm here to help."
