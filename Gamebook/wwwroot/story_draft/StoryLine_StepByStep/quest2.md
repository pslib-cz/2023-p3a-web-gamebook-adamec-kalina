# Quest 2: First Touch

player goes to **Shady Bar**
- NPCs: Barman
- player talks to **Barman**

```
Shadow Viper: "Hello, I hear this is a place where interesting people meet."
Bartender: "Interesting, you say? That depends on what you consider interesting."
Shadow Viper: "I'm looking for a group of people who aren't too keen on the way corporations run the city. I've heard that they might congregate here."
Bartender: "Many people have a problem with corporations, but few have the courage to do anything about it. Why do you ask?"
Shadow Viper: "I have reason to believe I'm part of this group... but I have gaps in my memory. I need to get in touch with them."
Bartender: "So you have gaps in your memory, huh? That's pretty common around here. But if you're really one of them, you should know how to connect with them."
Shadow Viper: "I know they have meetings here. Could you tell me where I can find them?"
Bartender: "I'm not saying I know anything, but people like you sometimes use that back entrance. Maybe you should try there."
```

- ***Location Unlock***: Part of the Bar
- ***Location Unlock***: Back Entrance

player goes to **Back Entrance**
- the back entrance needs a pin so he has to ask around

player talks to **Mysterious Guest**:

```
Shadow Viper: "Good evening, I heard you might know something about a group that meets in secret."
Mysterious Guest:  "Maybe yes, maybe no. Why would I tell a stranger anything?"
Shadow Viper: "I need to meet them. I have important information they might be interested in."
Mysterious Guest: "Everyone has 'important information'. But okay, maybe I can help you. The back door uses a combination lock. The code is a four digit number. If you're smart enough, you should be able to guess it."
Shadow Viper: "What's the code?"
Mysterious Guest: "I won't tell you the code directly, but I'll give you a hint. PIN PUZZLE HINT"
```

- the player goes to **back entrance** and finishes Pin PUZZLE

- ***Location Unlock***: Secret Meeting Place

player goes to **Secret Meeting Place**

- player talks to **Hacktivist Leader**:
```
Shadow Viper: "I was told I would find you here. I'm Shadow Viper, and I'm looking for answers about my past."
Hacktivist Leader: "Shadow Viper, I've heard of you. There is talk that you have memory problems, but that you were once one of us. Why should we believe you?"
Shadow Viper: "I've lost my memories, but I feel I have reasons to fight the corporations. I can help you."
Hacktivist Leader: "Many people want to fight the corporations, but few have the actual ability or courage to do so. How can you help?"
Shadow Viper: "I have cybernetic abilities and I'm willing to use them against corporations. I just need a chance to prove it."
Hacktivist Leader: "Cyber abilities, you say? Okay, let's see what you can do. We have an assignment here that could test your abilities."
Shadow Viper: "I'm ready. What do you need me to do?"
Hacktivist Leader: "We need to retrieve information from a corporate database. It's well protected, but with your abilities, you could do it. If you can do that, you'll prove to us that you're on our side."
Shadow Viper: "Understood. I'll give you the information."
End of Interview
Hacktivist Leader: "Alright, Shadow Viper. This quest will show you if you have what it takes to be part of our group. Don't let us down."
```

- **Hacking puzzl**

```
Shadow Viper: "Mission accomplished. The information from the corporate database is yours."
Hacktivist leader: "Impressive. Not only did you do it, but you did it with such efficiency and discretion. Looks like your abilities aren't just empty words."
Shadow Viper: "I want to learn more about my past and fight those who control this city. I believe your group may be the key."
Hacktivist Leader: "Your past remains a mystery, but your current abilities and determination speak for you. You are welcome in our group, Shadow Viper."
Shadow Viper: "Thank you. What's the next step?"
Hacktivist Leader: "Now that you are part of our group, you will be involved in important missions. We have a plan to weaken the corporations and expose their dark secrets."
Hacktivist leader: "Get ready, Shadow Viper. The fight you've just joined won't be easy. But with your skills and our strategy, we have a chance to change things for the better."
