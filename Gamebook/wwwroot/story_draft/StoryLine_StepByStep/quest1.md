Old Merchant: "Hmm, your face is familiar, but there are a lot of people hanging around this neighborhood. I might remember something, but I have my own worries right now."
Shadow Viper: "Can I help you with something?"
Old Merchant: "Well, I need a component to repair a piece of equipment. You can find it at Jake's electronics shop just down the road. Bring it to me and maybe I'll remember something useful."

Jake: "Oh, the old jerk. Oh well, I know what he needs. But it's not free. You have to promise me something."
Shadow Viper: "What do you want in return?"
Jake: "I've been having trouble with a local gang lately. I need someone to make sure they leave me alone. You don't have to confront them directly, just let them know it would be better to leave me alone."
Shadow Viper: "What am I supposed to do? I have no power or influence here."
Jake: "You're big and you look pretty dangerous. All you have to do is show up in their territory and show off a little. Talk about joining a bigger group, come up with something. They're pretty paranoid, so that's enough."
Shadow Viper: "All right, I'll do it. Then you'll give me the component?"
Jake: "Yes, you have my word. When you do, the component is yours."

Gang Leader: "Who wants to know?"
Shadow Viper: "I'm a middleman. Cuba has connections to some very powerful people. You don't want to mess with him."
Gang Leader: "And why should we trust you?"
Shadow Viper: "You don't have to. But if you have problems with Cuba, you can be sure that people who are more dangerous than me will come after you."

Old Merchant: "Oh, that's it. Thanks, young man. Well, I promised you the information. I saw you come into the Quarter. You were accompanied by a strange figure, looked like a hacker or something. You had some electronics on you, and it looked like you were planning something together."
Shadow Viper: "Do you know anything more about the character or what we were planning?"
Old Merchant: "Unfortunately no, that's all I saw. But the character was wearing a badge I've seen on people in a group that meets in a shady bar on the outskirts of the neighborhood. Maybe you'll find more answers there."
