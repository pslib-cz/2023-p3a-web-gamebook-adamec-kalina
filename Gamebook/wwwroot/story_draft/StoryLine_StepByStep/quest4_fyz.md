# Quest 4: Rescue Mission (Physical Ability Time Line)

- player goes to **Secret Meeting Place**
- player talks to **Hacktivist leader**
```
Hacktivist leader: 'Shadow Viper, we have a crisis situation. One of our key members has been captured by the corporation. We have reason to believe he is being held in one of their security facilities."
Shadow Viper: "Capture? That sounds like a serious problem. What exactly happened?"
Hacktivist Leader: "He was captured during reconnaissance. We believe he has valuable information they could use against us."
Shadow Viper: "Understood. And what do you expect me to do?"
Hacktivist Leader: "We need you to use your new physical abilities to infiltrate their facility and save them before it's too late. Your abilities make you an ideal candidate for this mission."
Shadow Viper: "I accept the mission. Do you know where they're holding him?"
Tech Expert: "Yes, we have the coordinates. However, the building is well guarded. You'll need a plan."
Shadow Viper: "I'll get ready. No member of our group can be left in the hands of the corporation."
Hacktivist Leader: "Okay, Shadow Viper. Counting on you. Be careful, but be quick."

- ***Location Unlock***: Tactical Room
- player goes to **Tactical Room.**
- player talks to **Technical Expert**

```
Technical Expert: "The building where they keep our member is one of the best guarded facilities in the city. We have to be smart in our approach."
Shadow Viper: "What are our options?"
Technical Expert: "We have several plans. We could try a direct attack, but that would be risky and could endanger the prisoners. My suggestion is to use your new abilities for silent infiltration."
Technical Expert: "I have drawings of the building and the layout of the security cameras and alarms. You can get in through the roof or the basement entrance."
Shadow Viper: "I prefer silent infiltration. Minimal risk to prisoners and less chance of detection."
Technical Expert: "Excellent. Once you get in, you'll have to be quick. The security is complex and if the alarm is activated, the situation will quickly become complicated."
Technical Expert: "I'll equip you with a few tools to help you overcome the security. I'll also provide you with a communicator so you can report progress to us."
Shadow Viper: "Once I find the prisoners, how do we get out?"
Tech Expert: "We have an escape plan in place. Once you free the prisoners, we'll direct you to the nearest safe exit."
Shadow Viper: "Okay, sounds like a solid plan. I'm ready."
