# Quest 4: Digital Infiltration (Time Line Hacking Skills)

- player goes to **Secret Meeting Place**
- player talks to **Hacktivist leader**

```
Hacktivist leader: 'We have a key task for you. We need to hack into a corporate database and obtain information that can greatly aid our cause."
Shadow Viper: "What information are we looking for?"
Hacktivist Leader: "We are looking for detailed plans and communications regarding new corporate projects that could have a devastating impact on the public. This data is stored in a well-protected database."
Shadow Viper: "I see. What are the security protocols for this database?"
Hacktivist Leader: "It's complicated. The database is protected by a series of firewalls, encryption protocols, and anti-hacking systems. But with your new skills, you should be able to break through them."
Shadow Viper: "Sounds like a challenge. What approach are we going to use?"
Hacktivist Leader: "Best bet is to use a direct neural link to our servers. I'll give you access to the latest hacking tools and real-time assistance."
Shadow Viper: "Okay, I'm ready to dive into the system and get the information."
Hacktivist Leader: "Remember, Shadow Viper, time is of the essence. The longer you are inside the system, the greater the risk of detection. Be quick and careful."
Shadow Viper: "I understand the risks. We'll start now."
